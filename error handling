An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each value can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects are used to represent real-world entities and their properties. For example, you can use an object to represent a person with properties like name, age, and address.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple JavaScript object representing a person:

const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: '123 Main St'
};
In this example, person is an object with three properties: name, age, and address. The values associated with these properties are a string, a number, and another string, respectively.
