Mouse events notify when the user uses the mouse (or similar input device) to interact with a component. Mouse events occur when the cursor enters or exits a component's onscreen area and when the user presses or releases one of the mouse buttons.

Tracking the cursor's motion involves significantly more system overhead than tracking other mouse events. That is why mouse-motion events are separated into Mouse Motion listener type (see How to Write a Mouse Motion Listener).

To track mouse wheel events, you can register a mouse-wheel listener. See How to Write a Mouse Wheel Listener for more information.

If an application requires the detection of both mouse events and mouse-motion events, use the MouseInputAdapter class. This class implements the MouseInputListener, a convenient interface that implements the MouseListener and MouseMotionListener interfaces. However, the MouseInputListener interface does not implement the MouseWheelListener interface.

Alternatively, use the corresponding AWT MouseAdapter class, which implements the MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, and MouseWheelListener interfaces.

The following example shows a mouse listener. At the top of the window is a blank area (implemented by a class named BlankArea). The mouse listener listens for events both on the BlankArea and on its container, an instance of MouseEventDemo. Each time a mouse event occurs, a descriptive message is displayed under the blank area. By moving the cursor on top of the blank area and occasionally pressing mouse buttons, you can fire mouse events.
