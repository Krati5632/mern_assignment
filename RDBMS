A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program used to create, update, and manage relational databases. Some of the most well-known RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

Keys play an important role in the relational database.
It is used to uniquely identify any record or row of data from the table. It is also used to establish and identify relationships between tables.
For example, ID is used as a key in the Student table because it is unique for each student. In the PERSON table, passport_number, license_number, SSN are keys since they are unique for each person.

3.
Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.
Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

As the name suggests, this principle states that each class should have one responsibility, one single purpose. This means that a class will do only one job, which leads us to conclude it should have only one reason to change.

We donâ€™t want objects that know too much and have unrelated behavior. These classes are harder to maintain. For example, if we have a class that we change a lot, and for different reasons, then this class should be broken down into more classes, each handling a single concern. Surely, if an error occurs, it will be easier to find.
